# DotStar-Artist
Drawing and visualizing tool for DotStar 240mm discs and 256 DotStar LED arrays

Draw with an MS-Paint like tool on either 240mm DotStar LED disks (255 LEDs per disc) or 32x8 DotStar rectangular arrays (both available from Adafruit).  Code can be exported as C-style arrays for inclusion in Arduino sketches.

Originally written by Shawn Wilson for Ryan Zwicker's Pavlov Lives art piece, displayed at 2016 Nocturne event, Halifax, Nova Scotia.  Two disks were used for eyes and one rectangle for the mouth.  Eye/mouth combinations could be chosen by viewers.
